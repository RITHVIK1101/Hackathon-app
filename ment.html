        A balanced and nutritious diet is important for good mental health. Eating a variety of foods from all food groups, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats can provide the nutrients your brain and body need to function optimally. Some specific foods that have been linked to better mental health include:
        <br>
        <br>
        Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish such as salmon, nuts, and seeds
        <br>
        <br>
        Antioxidant-rich foods, such as berries, leafy greens, and dark chocolate
        <br>
        <br>
        Probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt and kefir, that support gut health and the gut-brain connection
        <br>
        <br>
        Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, that provide a steady source of energy
        <br>
        <br>
        Vitamin B-rich foods, such as eggs, poultry, and leafy greens, that support brain health
        <br>
        <br>
        It is also important to limit processed and high-fat foods, as well as caffeine and alcohol, as these can negatively affect mental health.

        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Resistance training: Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises can boost self-esteem and improve overall mood.
        <br>
